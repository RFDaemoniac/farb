## owned_ptr / value_ptr ##
for members of structs that behave like refs but are re-assignable
like unique_ptr but copy assignment will perform new rather than requiring move
so that you can use implicit copy constructors of structs that contain members that are owned_ptr<T>

take a look at shared_ptr/weak_ptr and the other stb pointer classes

this is called a value_ptr and implementations already exist

## unowned_ptr / observer_ptr ##
takes no responisibility for ownership, pretty much just a raw pointer
but advertises it as such as opposed to the ambiguity of a raw ptr
