how to do animations?
I like css's animated properties over time
Keyframes also seems like a good abstraction
as well as tweening functions


html rendering engine as example

scaled and/or 9 sliced images
dependency graph that collapses to a list
dependencies are the actual node attributes, top, left, right, bottom, width, height, children
list is of dimensions to compute, x, y, width, height
pass previous children dimensions in along with window and parent. unlike parent, you can expect all previous children to have been completed
