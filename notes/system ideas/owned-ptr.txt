for members of structs that behave like refs but are re-assignable
like unique_ptr but copy assignment will perform new rather than requiring move
so that you can use implicit copy constructors of structs that contain members that are owned_ptr<T>

take a look at shared_ptr/weak_ptr and the other stb pointer classes

this is called a value_ptr and implementations already exist
